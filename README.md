# Automatically provision users and groups

This repository contains code that does the following:

1. The script should create users and groups and set up home directories with appropriate permissions and ownership
2. Generates random passwords for the users, and logs all actions to /var/log/user_management.log.
3. Additionally, the generated passwords are stored securely in /var/secure/user_passwords.txt
